## Dev (WIP)

## 1.1.1 (2025-07-12)
Hotfix: fixed log message extra spacing, fixed version confusion.

## 1.0.1 (2025-07-12)
An update. (Note: this should be `1.1.0`, but it was mis-labeled as `1.0.1`.)
- No longer depends on HugsLib; depends on Harmony instead ([#1](https://github.com/Vectorial1024/PlayerLogWarning/issues/1))
  - It's rare to have mod update news anyway (which would depend on HugsLib)
  - Update changenotes will be delivered via this document
- No feature changes

## 1.0.0 (2024-05-18)
Initial release.

This mod notifies the player of extra-large `Player.log` files, which is usually an indication something has gone really wrong with the (usually modded) setup.
