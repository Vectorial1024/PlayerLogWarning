[h1]Mod Features[/h1]
Once per RimWorld app launch, when starting a new game or loading a game, this mod checks the Player-prev.log for its size; if it is too large (>= 100MB), a popup will be displayed.

Checking the Player.log file directly is useless because it is always near-empty when the check happens; the old Player.log will be rotated to Player-prev.log, so we will be checking that.
